#American Karate website

This is a website for American Karate. It is built with simple, standard HTML5 and CSS3. I've consciously avoided using JavaScript to keep the site design as maintainable as possible for anyone who may come after me to make changes or updates.

The original code for this site is on Github: https://github.com/strohmy/americankarate
