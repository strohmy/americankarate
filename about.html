        <p>American Karate was established in Antioch, California in 1988 at the Raley's Shopping Center on Lone Tree Way.  After 14 years at that location we moved to Brentwood, California to the Sand Creek Crossing Shopping Center and opened in November, 2002.  In 2017 we moved to 8650 Brentwood Blvd. Suite H. The academy is one of the most respected in the Contra Costa County area.</p>
        <p>Classes are taught in a relaxed atmosphere and are fun for the entire family.  Karate has so much more to offer than just kicking or punching.  We teach life skills.  Our students develop coordination, confidence, goal setting, and leadership skills.  It's a terrific way to release stress giving you more energy, getting you in great shape, and is fun to do.</p>
